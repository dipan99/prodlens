Generate SQL to find the product_id for: {query}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- There might NOT be a perfect/exact match for the product name in the database
- Use LIKE with wildcards (%) for fuzzy matching: '%keyword%'
- Break down the query into key terms (brand, type, features) and use OR conditions
- Include product_name in SELECT to verify matches
- Order results by relevance (best matches first) using CASE statements
- Return top 1 match, not just exact matches

Example pattern:
WHERE (column LIKE '%term1%' OR column LIKE '%term2%' OR column LIKE '%term3%')
ORDER BY CASE WHEN best_match THEN 1 ELSE 2 END
