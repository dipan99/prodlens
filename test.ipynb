      "# Today we are launching Comet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comet is a web browser built for today’s internet. In the last 30 years, the internet has evolved from something we simply “browse” or “search.” The internet is where we live, work, and connect.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s also where we ask questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Curious minds have questions everywhere, and they find answers on every page, in every idea, through every task. Yet we've been trapped in long lines of tabs and hyperlinks, disjointed experiences that interrupt our natural flow of thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, the internet has become humanity's extended mind while our tools for using it remain primitive. Our interface for the web should be as fluid and responsive as human thought itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "We built Comet to let the internet do what it has been begging to do: to amplify our intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### From Navigation To Cognition\n",
      "\n",
      "Comet powers a shift from browsing to thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tabs that piled up waiting for your return now join one intelligent interface that understands how your mind works. Context-switching between dozens of applications, sites, and interfaces has stolen the focus and flow that bring joy to our work and fuel our curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Comet assistant removes friction with every thought, actively conducting entire browsing sessions while you focus on what matters. Ask Comet which other sites have the same bike but ship it faster. Ask Comet to compare what you’re reading to something you already read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comet allows you to ask questions anywhere they occur to you, whether you want to understand a complex concept, find hidden connections, create new possibilities, or solve problems that have been puzzling you.... ### From Answers To Action\n",
      "\n",
      "Comet transforms entire browsing sessions into single, seamless interactions, collapsing complex workflows into fluid conversations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ask Comet to book a meeting or send an email, based on something you saw. Ask Comet to buy something you forgot. Ask Comet to brief you for your day.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Comet, you don't search for information—you think out loud, and Comet executes complete workflows while keeping perfect context. Research becomes conversation. Analysis becomes natural. Annoying tasks evaporate. The internet becomes an extension of your mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "### From Believability To Accuracy\n",
      "\n",
      "In the DNA of Comet is Perplexity’s obsession with accurate and trustworthy answers. Answers are the foundation of curiosity for one reason: more knowledge gives us better questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every day, trillions of dollars of decisions are made online, and the quality of those decisions depends on the reliability of the information behind them. Ask Comet to compare insurance plans. Ask Comet to help you understand a technology enough to decide whether to invest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accurate answers are the foundation of decision-making. This will compound in importance with agentic AI, when assistants make decisions for us, faster and more often. Comet is like a second brain, helping with the best possible decisions in every situation.... ### From Consumption To Curiosity\n",
      "\n",
      "Perplexity’s mission is to serve the world’s curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comet transforms any webpage into a portal of curiosity. Highlight any text to get instant explanations. Explore tangential ideas without losing your original context. Ask specialized questions or broad ones—Comet understands that genuine curiosity doesn't follow predetermined paths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ask Comet what you’re missing. Ask Comet for counterpoints. Ask Comet where you should explore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Curiosity is personal. This allows your own curiosity to become the context for a reliable, proactive, and personalized assistant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comet learns how you think, in order to think better with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "### From Here To What's Next\n",
      "\n",
      "Beginning today, Comet is available to Perplexity Max subscribers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Invite-only access will roll out slowly to our waitlist over the summer. New users will also receive a limited number of invites to share.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, you can join the waitlist here.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’ll be worth the wait, because Comet is just getting started.\n",
      "\n",
      "With our own roadmap, and with every new advancement in AI, we will continue to launch new features and functionality for Comet, improve experiences based on your feedback, and focus relentlessly–as we always have–on building accurate and trustworthy AI that fuels human curiosity. The future belongs to the people who never stop asking questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're curious to see what you'll ask of Comet.\n",
