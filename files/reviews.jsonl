It weighs a mere 24 grams, has a polling rate of up to 8000Hz, is made out of carbon fiber, and is made specifically for fingertip grippers. However, it’s also extremely interesting despite the price."}

Despite the drawbacks, the performance is noteworthy, especially in fast-paced games."}
{"product_id": 2394, "rating": 5, "source": "Unknown", "review_title": "My favorite fingertip shape", "review_text": "This mouse is an awesome shape for fingertip and there aren't any other options remotely like it.
